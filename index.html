			<p id="worktitle"><em>Empathy and Vulnerability<br/> with Jonathan and Michael Bean</em></p>
			<p>Empathy, the ability to relate to another person’s feelings as if they were your own (without losing the “as if” quality), is connected with having a better life in a myriad of ways. Vulnerability, as championed by social scientist and author <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability?language=en">Brene Brown</a>, is essential to the experience of intimacy and connection in human relationships.</p>
			<p>This workshop is simple at its heart – each person has an opening to experience as much vulnerability as they choose to experience, and to receive as much empathy as they’re ready to receive. It opens up an opportunity to experience the risk and reward of being witnessed in our experience and provides a chance to question the story that we create about ourselves in difficult moments. Everyone will be given a chance to edge past their comfort zone and experience what it’s like to take a risk and to be deeply supported in that risk by their community and their peers. There are profound gifts in being vulnerable – this workshop is for anyone who wants to find out exactly what those are.</p>
